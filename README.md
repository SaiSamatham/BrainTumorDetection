## Brain Tumor Segmentation from MRI Images

Welcome to the **Brain Tumor Segmentation** MATLAB project. This tool is designed to process MRI brain images to automatically identify and segment potential tumor regions using a combination of advanced image preprocessing, adaptive thresholding, and the **Watershed Segmentation** technique. The primary goal is to provide a clear, visual output that highlights the segmented tumor areas, which can be useful for medical image analysis and research.

## Project Objective

The core objectives of this project are to:

* **Process** a random sample of brain MRI images from a dataset.
* **Segment** tumor regions by utilizing adaptive thresholding to determine foreground and background markers for Watershed Segmentation.
* **Refine** the boundaries of the segmented regions using morphological operations.
* **Visualize** the results by overlaying the segmented tumor area onto the original MRI image.

## Methods Used

The MATLAB script employs a comprehensive workflow for image processing and segmentation:

1.  **Image Preprocessing**:
    * **Noise Reduction**: A **Gaussian filter** (`imgaussfilt`) is applied to smooth the image and reduce noise.
    * **Contrast Enhancement**: **Adaptive Histogram Equalization** (`adapthisteq`) is used to improve the local contrast, making tumor boundaries clearer.
2.  **Gradient Magnitude**: The **gradient magnitude** (`imgradient`) is computed on the enhanced image to highlight edges, which are crucial for the Watershed algorithm.
3.  **Adaptive Thresholding and Marker Generation**:
    * The `adaptthresh` function is used to create a unique, local threshold map for the enhanced image.
    * **Foreground (Tumor) Markers** and **Background Markers** are generated by binarizing the image using thresholds derived from the standard deviation and mean of the adaptive threshold map.
4.  **Watershed Preparation**: The **H-minima transform** (`imimposemin`) is used to modify the gradient image, enforcing the custom-defined foreground and background markers to prevent **over-segmentation** typical of the standard Watershed algorithm.
5.  **Morphological Operations**:
    * **Area Opening** (`bwareaopen`) removes small, irrelevant objects (noise).
    * **Closing** (`imclose`) is used to close small gaps or holes within the potential tumor boundaries, yielding a smoother, more continuous region.
6.  **Visualization**: The final segmented regions are **overlaid** (`imoverlay`) in red on the original MRI image for easy and intuitive inspection.

## Usage

This project assumes you have the necessary image dataset in a compressed file named `BrainTumors.zip` located in the same directory as the MATLAB script.

1.  **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure your zipped dataset is named `BrainTumors.zip` and contains subfolders with the MRI images. The script is configured to automatically unzip and create an `imageDatastore`.
2.  **Run the Script**: Open and execute the `Brain_Tumor_Classification.m` file in MATLAB.
3.  **Review Output**: The script will randomly select and process **10** images from the dataset. For each of the 10 images, a figure window will display a **3x3 grid** of the processing steps, including:
    * Original MRI Image
    * Smoothed Image
    * Contrast Enhanced Image
    * Gradient Magnitude
    * Tumor Markers (Foreground)
    * Background Markers
    * Cleaned Tumor Regions
    * **Overlay of Tumor Regions on Original (Final Result)**
    * Combined Markers

## Future Work

To enhance the performance and clinical utility of this tool, future developments could focus on:

* **Quantitative Analysis**: Incorporating feature extraction to calculate metrics such as tumor **area, perimeter, and circularity**.
* **Full Watershed Implementation**: Implementing the actual Watershed transform on the modified gradient image to finalize segmentation based on the markers.
* **Classification**: Integrating a machine learning model (e.g., CNN) after segmentation to **classify the tumor type** (e.g., Meningioma, Glioma, Pituitary).
* **User Interface**: Developing a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to easily select image files and customize processing parameters.
